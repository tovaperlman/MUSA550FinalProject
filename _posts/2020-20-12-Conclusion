## Conclusion

	Overall, the exploration of this data provided insights into the claims of protests that occurred in both summers, the types of events and the crowd size by date. Additionally, we identified a few counties which have potential to create lasting change with their crowd size. Some challenges with this dataset were that it was entirely created by humans and there were errors with writing in county names as well as in the ways claims and event types were categorized. This made the data visualization more challenging and less effective. Future research in this dataset might include other columns regarding specific locations of the protests and if they were pro or anti their claims. We also might want to look at other datasets around protests including ones that focus on other parts of the world like the NAVCO database Chenoweth created, as well as looking at Twitter data surrounding protests and their locations and associations.
